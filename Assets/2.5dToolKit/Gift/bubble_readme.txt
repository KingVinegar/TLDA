You could use this prefab in your game. 
It's a nice Broken Sword style bubble. You can customize it by changing colors, fonts, size, position.
You can make it appear on the bottom of the screen as "Narrator" or above the character's head as "Player".
You can see an example in the "Recreating a short Broken Sword scene" video.

Usage: open the SubtitlesUI scene and drag the prefab into the Hierarchy. If you don't see the balloon, check prefab is enabled.
Remember to work on a copy to always have the original available.
